        <h2>He picked tennis over soccer at 12 years old</h2>
        <p>
          With soccer in his blood and tennis being so demanding, Rafael Nadal
          had to make a serious decision when he was 12 years old. There was an
          opportunity to continue focusing on soccer only and hoping for the
          best, or to pursue tennis full-time. He chose the latter, and although
          itâ€™s impossible to tell how great he could have been on the pitch,
          most think he made the right decision.
